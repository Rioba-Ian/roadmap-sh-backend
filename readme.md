### Project 1

Number guessing Game.
The game is a simple command-line game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game will give hints to the user if the guessed number is too high or too low. The game will also keep track of the number of guesses the user has made.
You can view how to play the game by reading the ![README.md](https://github.com/Rioba-Ian/roadmap-sh-backend/tree/main/go-number-guessing) file.
